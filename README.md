## splitsbin

splitsbin is a website similar to Pastebin or GitHub Gist, but for splits
generated from speedruns rather than text or code.

### Development

splitsbin is in development. The general bucket list is:

* Be able to import splits from all popular splits programs (WSplit, Llanfair,
  Time Split Tracker, and SplitterZ, among others)
  * In terms of code, this should be set up so supporting a new program is a
    matter of writing a regex version of the program's file format, with minimal
    other effort
* Be able to upload files by dragging and dropping them onto any page, similar
  to Imgur (done)
* Allow unregistered users to upload splits
* Allow users to log in using their Twitch account (done, just in another
  project for now)
* Supply short-ish permalinks to every uploaded set of splits (done)
* Supply timeline charts for each set of splits (done, also in another project)
