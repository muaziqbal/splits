    %h4 Run permalinks
    %p
      Permalinks for your all of your runs have been changed.
    %p
      Old permalinks will continue to work for some time. The site is automatically collecting data about how often old
      permalinks are used, and once this number drops off to a sufficiently low amount (ideally zero), I'll remove the
      logic and the database column that support the old-style permalinks.
    %p
      Old-style permalinks were randomly-generated base 64 4-character strings. There are
      %code 64^4 = 16 777 216
      permutations of this pattern, so yeah, it's probably safe to say we weren't going to hit that cap any time soon
      (we're currently at #{Run.count}).
    %p
      Despite this, there are some reasons I grew to not like this style:
      %ol
        %li Even if the limit is really really high, it's still there, and that irks me.
        %li
          As more runs get uploaded, the chance of generating a URL that's already in use rises. When one that's in use
          gets generated, we just try again until one works. So the expected time it takes to generate one sort of rises
          with every run uploaded. Again this is pretty negligible, especially this early on, but again with the irking.
        %li
          URLs are longer than they need to be. We're not taking advantage of the
          %code (64^1) + (64^2) + (64^3) = 266 304
          URLs that we can get from one-, two-, and three-character URLs.
        %li
          Having just one form of identification for a run, like a not-crazy person would do, makes some API stuff that
          I've been wanting to do a bit simpler. That API stuff will in turn let programs access splits.io in a less
          volatile fashion than they have to right now.
        %li In general, complexity where there doesn't need to be any is bad.
      The new style isn't actually base 64, it's base 36 (so, lowercase alphabet and 0-9). But it's translated to base
      36 from the base 10 IDs that runs already have, which is how it probably should be.
      - if Run.count < 47_988
        So we're actually getting
        %code (36^1) + (36^2) + (36^3) = 47 988
        1-3 character URLs. We've still got #{47_988 - Run.count} uploads before we hit the point when the fourth
        character starts kicking in!
    %p
      I realize that changing stuff around like this contradicts the very idea of a permalink. My hope is that with this
      cleaner system, permalink fetching/generation will be more efficient and will be sludging up
      %a{href: 'https://github.com/glacials/splits-io', target: :_blank} the code base
      no longer. Sometimes you have to get dirty to clean stuff up.
    %p
      If you have any thoughts about any of this, or you have a run that you strongly feel should not have its URL
      changed, let me know and we can talk it out.

  %h4 My door is always open
  %h5
    because that dang top hinge fell off last week and the bottom one was too rusted to pick up the slack and the
    landlord won't acknowledge and just ugh
  If you ever have any questions about why stuff is or isn't the way that it is or (respectively) isn't, you can always
  drop me a line, or a square or a circle. No triangles please though, I have too many of those.
