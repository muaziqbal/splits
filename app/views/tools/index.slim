    h4 Delete your account
    p If you like, you can permanently delete your account on splits i/o. You can recreate it later by signing in with
      Twitch again, but it will be a fresh account with no runs.
    p You can choose to cascade this deletion to all your runs, or to disown them instead. Disowned runs do not belong to
      any user and will not be reclaimable, even if you recreate your account. Your name will not appear on them.
    p
      center style='color: #d22' This is a hard delete. We cannot restore your account if you change your mind.
